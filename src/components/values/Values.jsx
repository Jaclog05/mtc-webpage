            <h4>The relationship with God</h4>
            <p>We love God with all our heart, soul, mind, and with all our strength. He is the priority of our love, obedience and worship, above all things; if you take away God, you take away life itself (Luke 10:27).</p>
            
            <h4>The family</h4>
            <p>It is a fundamental principle in the kingdom of God. The union in marriage between a man and a woman is the will of God, and keeps a society free of immorality. If the family is lost, the foundation of society is lost; that is why we care after and protect marriage, till death do them part (Genesis 1:27)</p>
            
            <h4>The Word of God</h4>
            <p>Every declaration, every word and every commandment written in the Bible is the law for us, and we commit to follow it (Proverbs 3:3; 2 Timothy 3:16).</p>
